#### Getting Started

  * Make sure all scrips are executable (ie. 'chmod -R +x *') 
 
  * Run 'utils/get_dep.py' to download and install all required dependencies
  
  * Make sure you have your mic set up, and run 'main.py' to get started!

#### Tips
  * Adjust your configuration files to account for words that may sound similiar. The more<br>
    syllables the higher the accuracy, theoretically.
  
  * Consider using the NATO phonetic alphabet to spell words.
  
  * Prefix short utterances, and link phrases together with dashes so they get compiled as<br>
    a single phrase in the language model.
